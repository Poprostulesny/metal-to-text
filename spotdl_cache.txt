Tell you everything is fine\nEvery single fucking day I get closer to the grave\nI am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again\nCrashed my car just to feel again\nIt obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm about to break down\nI'm searching for a way out\nI'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer\nI'm a popular, popular monster\nI break down\nFalling into love now\nWith falling apart\nI'm a popular, popular fucking monster\n\n\n[Breakdown]\nYeah\nYeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh\nWe're sick and tired of wondering\nPraying to a god that you don't believe\nYou're searching for the truth in the lost and found\nSo the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm about to break down\nI'm searching for a way out\nI'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer\nI'm a popular, popular monster\nI break down\nFalling into love now\nWith falling apart\nI'm a popular, popular monster\n\n[Outro]\nI'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer\nI'm a popular, popular monster",

        "lyrics": "3 ContributorsLord of Flies LyricsThe perpetual fire shimmers before all that lives and dies\nLegions of fallen angels gather unparalleled, stalking in the dusk of light\nAs death strikes into those who defend ignorance and deceit\n\nBestowed is the fate of hypocrisy;\nCrushed underneath me\nA cry in the dark before perishing to the mark of blackened beasts, salivating as they claw and rape\nThe lord of the flies exhaling pestilence with every breath\nTransient passageways open releasing Hell's wake \u2013 A realm sentenced to the fires of hate\nNow tear at the wings of our enemies and cast them down into the flames\nDie for the sins you create\n\nThe ouroboros encompassing\nA kingdom fallen to the darkness forged within\nAll servants and angels are torn to shreds\nWith beast-like carnage, terror fills their hearts\nBow to your fucking king\n\nSlaughter those in our way\nLeave no saint unscathed\nTheir numbers dwindling\nCast into the flames\n\n[Verse: Tom Barber]\nAnd now you see now I\u2019m far from myth\nAnd now you feel the fear \u2013 I am the obelisk\nForged from the fire \u2013 The hatred of man\nAll enveloped in the shadow, I bring death to this land\nBreathe deep for only ashes will cleanse your lungs\nMouths wide open \u2013 Bring forth razors to the tongue\nAcid winds will pull the flesh from the bone\n\n\n(I claw at the eyes of the sun, blackening out the reign of man. Releasing my ancient hate upon this realm. Burdened by waste and pain, I am baptized in the blood of mortality.)\n\nAs above / So below\nThe final hour approaches with the dying of the light\nAs within / So without\nHumanity becomes enslaved \u2013 Bound to an ancient hate\n\nCollapsing from the loss of blood\nThe voices of hatred howl in forsaken tongues\nDestined as the oracles of annihilation\nDamned to remain helpless, consumed are the worthless\n\nInto the palace\nThe pelts of innocent souls are flayed\nStripped and maimed, unworthy of peace as the eyes are hollowed and ate\nThere will be no bargains \u2013 There will be only darkness as the Great devourer consumes the will of your fucking souls\n\nA righteous genocide\nBring me the coward alive\nGiven the death of life\nBring me the father of Christ\n\nEnslaved for an eternity, shrouded by the fray of war\nPeer within my soulless eyes\nDroned by flies, exonerated to a veil of voiceless prison\nInto the depths of Sheol, never to return\nSentenced to a grave of undying misery\nHeld above all is the head of God\nUse your eyes and see, servants of the sky, that not all that you believe is what truly appears to be\n\n\nDecapitated for the masses to see\nBow in obedience to your true king\nI, Beelzebub, cast your lifeless corpse into the void whilst I hold my trophy above mankind\nDecapitated for the masses to see\nI am the one who stands above you as you mourn your fallen king\nI, Lord of Flies, bestow my reign above the Earth and in the Skies",

        "lyrics": "5 ContributorsRemnant Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDaylight, we haven't seen it in forever\nIt's all just different shades of ash\nI still remember how the red dot sight\nWas warning my chest\nThe final breaths\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd once they called this Eden\nBut I am sure that must have passed\nBut I will keep imagining\nFor that is all we have left\nSince the day when the sky was opened\nWe were blinded by the lights from above\nWe stand in silence awaiting the final cull\n(We ar\u0435 the afterglow)\n\n[Chorus]\nWe ar\u0435 the afterglow\nOf an antidote\nTo the ones who won't let go\nWe are but ghosts\n\n[Verse 3]\nHide\nDo you hear that? (Do you hear that?)\nThat is the sound of life\nDon't let it fool you\nThat's how they lure you to die\nRun\nDo you feel that? (Do you feel that?)\nThey are getting closer now\nBut don't you turn around\nNo\nThis one depends on our lives\n\n\n[Verse 4]\nSoul readers\nHuman shadow of death\nA tragic silhouette\nSoul readers\nThey are here to collect\nTear the heart out your chest\nWill it outweigh the feather?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the afterglow\nOf an antidote\nTo the ones who won't let go\nWe are but ghosts\nDaylight, a distant, elusive dream\nA requiem for the world, forever unseen\nFollow the ashes in the snow\nAwait the deathblow\n\n[Breakdown]\nWe are but ghosts (Ghosts, ghosts)\nWe are but ghosts\n\nWeigh our hearts against the feather\nIn this dance of death\nWe are but ghosts\nForever together\nWeigh our hearts against the feather\nWe are but ghosts\nForever together (Together)\nTogether\n\n\n[Bridge]\nHold me closer, don't let go\nHold me closer, don't let go\nI won't let go\nLet you go\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are the afterglow\nTo the ones who won't let go\nWe are but ghosts\nGhosts\n\n[Outro]\nForever together",
